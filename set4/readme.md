For the IO examples I learned that the first argument is a string that has the filename. The second argument is another string that has a few characters describing how the file is going to be used.

'r' is the mode when the file will only be read.
'w' is for write
'a' opens the file for appending hence, any data that is written to the file will be added to the end
'r+' opens the file for reading and writing

I found it difficult to proceed with the pokedex within exercise 1 however, took some time researching and asking my peers about how to go on with this script of python.
