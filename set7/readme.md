I learned how to apply loops within the script. Apply returns the same value but as a pandas series.

A list comprehension has a python structure and does a function in one line so it's simpler for us to understand as it has staples. It's quick and seen as a python pattern. Hence, it foes through a list of things to give us a value.

For the list comprehension there is a python structure,
lengths - [len(name) for name in names]
print (lengths)

Some terms such as "packing" and "enumerate" are still vague to me.
