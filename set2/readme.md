I learned how to modify each function so it returns the correct number within the terminal. Exercise 2 enabled me to debug a code, have an overview of the components of the Python syntax as well as correct the syntax.

Utilising 'loop' to create a block of code was difficult for me as I did not know how to input the range of the numbers, hence to better my understanding I decided to google and experiment with different syntax.

I also learned that triple quotes refers to the docstring and is pivotal in functions within python because it explains what it does for us to understand.
