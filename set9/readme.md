I learned that machine learning gains experience from data which is grouped into 3 categories: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.Supervised is learning from labelled data which is extensive as an individual will need to name the data. Unsupervised learning is when AI will learn from unlabelled data while reinforcement is when it learns from trial an error, resulting in a reward. Moreover, neural networks is inspired by the human brain and is a system for mapping inputs to outputs which require a lot of data to learn tasks.
