Get acquainted with pandas and matPlotLib.

From this week, I found an interesting data set about squirrels in nyc. I had difficulty trying to come up with a burning question that needed to be answered for my dataset. I also had difficulty within the last few weeks trying to find a dataset as it was either too boring or limited in research/information I could use in my presentation.
