In exercise 1, I had difficulty doing the stubborn asker. By going through the lecture and google, I concluded that I need a while loop as it only gets tested by integers. This is also utilised in the not_number_rejector but also has the try / catch block which includes getting a lot of inputs that are not a number, string, list, dictionary etc.

I also learned a new syntax "in" which is applied in a collection which is answered in a Boolean. The Boolean concludes if that something is 'in' the collection.
